# sonic-dev

A self-contained SONiC virtual testbed for developing, testing and benchmarking the
transceiver daemon (`xcvrd`) — including an automated pipeline that translates it from
Python to Rust and grades the result.

Everything runs on one Linux host with nested virtualization: a KVM SONiC DUT, its
neighbor VMs, a `sonic-mgmt` container, and an emulated transceiver plant. No physical
optics required.

```

## Running it

`setup-sonic-testbed.sh` is the interface to the whole repo — 1 700 lines, ~34 phases,
each idempotent and individually re-runnable. Build the testbed from nothing:

```bash
./setup-sonic-testbed.sh                 # runs every setup phase in order
```

Then drive it a phase at a time:

```bash
./setup-sonic-testbed.sh emulator                              # deploy the emulated optics
./setup-sonic-testbed.sh xcvrd_tests                           # black-box suite vs stock python xcvrd
./setup-sonic-testbed.sh xcvrd_tests_rust recodeAgent/results/result_4
./setup-sonic-testbed.sh xcvrd_status                          # which daemon is live?
./setup-sonic-testbed.sh xcvrd_restore                         # un-strand an injected rust daemon
```

Tab completion:

```bash
eval "$(./setup-sonic-testbed.sh --completion bash)"
```

USAGE
  ./setup-sonic-testbed.sh [<phase>] [args...]
  ./setup-sonic-testbed.sh --help | --list-phases | --completion bash

  With no phase it runs all (every setup phase in order). Every phase is
  re-runnable on its own.

Each directory carries its own README with the detail.

## PR review agent

`recodeAgent/agents/sonic-pr-reviewer.agent.md` is a read-only Copilot CLI agent
with repository-specific context for the testbed, emulator bridge, black-box
oracle, translation pipeline, and benchmarks. Install the version-controlled
profiles and run it from the repository root:

```bash
bash recodeAgent/tools/install_agents.sh
copilot -p "Review the current branch against main" \
  --agent sonic-pr-reviewer --reasoning-effort high --allow-all
```

The command intentionally remains interactive so the reviewer can ask for a base
branch, lab evidence, or a related submodule PR when that context is required.

## How the pieces fit

**The emulator replaces hardware.** `platform/` implements the SONiC platform API over
gRPC to `xcvr-emu`, so an unmodified `xcvrd` reads and writes EEPROM on emulated optics.
`emu-deploy/` installs it. This is what makes plugging, faulting and reconfiguring a
transceiver a scripted operation.

**`xcvrd-tests/` is the correctness oracle.** It never imports the daemon — it drives
stimulus through the emulator and reads STATE_DB, so the same suite grades any
implementation. That independence is why it can serve as the pipeline's verdict.

**`recodeAgent/` produces the translations** under `results/result_N`, each graded by
that suite via `xcvrd_tests_rust`. `CodeWeaver/` is the same pipeline generalized —
identical agent methodology, but every project-specific detail lives in a config file,
so it translates arbitrary codebases rather than only `xcvrd`.

**`benchmark/` measures them.** The DUT harness benchmarks the real supervised process
(works for any translation); the in-process harness links a translation as a library for
per-task detail. See `benchmark/README.md`.

## Requirements

A Linux host with nested virtualization, passwordless sudo, docker, and a large data
mount (default `/mnt/data`). `./setup-sonic-testbed.sh preflight` checks all of it and
`install_prereqs` installs the rest.

Clone with submodules (`xcvr-emu`, `CodeWeaver`):

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/gsoosk/sonic-dev
# already cloned:
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
